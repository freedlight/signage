# signage
util to talk to BetaBrite LED signs over serial, MS-DOS

This compiles under Borland C++, and uses Borland-proprietary API calls.  I hope to get this working under Windows (command-line only) Real Soon Now...

This includes custom-charaacter support, and a rudimentary subset of Japanese Katakana characters (used for a demo at Coca-Cola some time back).
